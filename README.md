# BankApp

---

## DESCRIPTION

This is an **INCOMPLETE mini** bank application written in C. It is used to reinforce concepts and skills gained during the first trimester at **ALX**. There are many features missing at present and that makes contribution possible as there are stuffs you can help with. Check the **_FEARTURES MISSING_** section for more info.

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

> To install this program:

1. `git clone <repo_url>`
2. `cd BankApp; cd bank_app`
3. `source ./build.sh`
4. `./bank`

## FEATURES MISSING

- _A User Interface (The **bank.c** file is created for that purpose)._
- _I believe a bank app should be network-enabled and this is not. So, the function that handles transfer from a customer to another is incomplete. The money transferred disappears and that is not right._
- _A database is needed for every bank application...It is missing here :wink:_
- _Very funny :grinning:; This bank app doesn't use account number... You might be interested._
- _Every customer should have an ID to identify them easily, I failed again.:smirk:_
- _The source code is not explanatory enough, so you can write a documentation for it._
- _This list is not exhaustive enough...There could be other features that elude me which you can think of in a fly_

## FEATURES IN PROGRESS

At present, I am trying to implement a database system for the customers, because the use of files
is becoming inefficient.

**THE DATABASE SYSTEM WILL**:

- store a new customer's info.
- dynamically updates the database once any customer's data is updated.
- allows the database to be queried using simple query commands such as CREATE, INSERT, and more.

## CONTRIBUTION

- In other to contribute to this, follow the **INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS** section.
- Once accomplished, create a branch from which you will contribute. That can be done by:

```
git branch <name>

git checkout <name>
```

- Do all your stuffs, then `git add`, `commit` and `push` to repo.
- Make a pull request to me, and I will be kind enough to reply. I am a gentleman :smiley:.

## _PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT_

- I undertook this project after learning the essential features of the C programming language.
I wanted to condense the knowledge thus gathered into a project which, though **dummy**, models
a real world project.
- Also I noticed that most open source C projects were not done with beginners or intermediate C
programmers in mind... I then tried to make this incomplete to help other upcoming C programmers
find something useful to work on that will build their confidence as C programmers.
