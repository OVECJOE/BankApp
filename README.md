# BankApp
---
## DESCRIPTION
This is an **INCOMPLETE mini** bank application written in C. It is used to reinforce concepts and skills gained during the first trimester at **ALX**. There are many features missing at present and that makes contribution possible as there are stuffs you can help with. Check the **_FEARTURES MISSING_** section for more info.
## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
> To install this program:
1. `git clone <repo_url>`
2. `cd BankApp`
3. `source ./build`
4. `./bank`
## FEATURES MISSING
- _A User Interface (The **bank.c** file is created for that purpose)._
- _I believe a bank app should be network-enabled and this is not. So, the function that handles transfer from a customer to another is incomplete. The money transferred disappears and that is not right._
- _A database is needed for every bank application...It is missing here :wink:_
- _Very funny :grinning:; This bank app doesn't use account number... You might be interested._
- _Every customer should have an ID to identify them easily, I falied again.:smirk:_
- _The source code is not explanatory enough, so you can write a documentation for it._
- _This list is not exhaustive enough...There could be other features that elude me which you can think of in a fly_
